This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland. So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes).

*Workshop led by [Celine Carle-Faye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/celine-carle-faye/) (Resilio), referent for the Digital Collage in Switzerland, and [Laurent Puijalon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurent-puijalon-468630/) (Redsen Consulting).*

The Digital Collage is a fun, collaborative half-day workshop with a similar pedagogy to that of the Climate Fresk. The aim of this "serious game" is to raise awareness and educate participants about the environmental challenges of digital technology.

Celine took up the challenge of introducing the workshop in 20 minutes, stopwatch in hand!
After a brief explanation of the digital collage, its format and its purpose, Celine and Laurent positioned us around a table to begin the 1st stage of a digital collage: understanding the subject. To do this, the group of participants had to read out their card(s) in an intelligible voice. Then the group had to link the cards together according to the dependencies between them. 

The initial cards were
- "Sharing and learning", 
- "Communicating"
- "play and have fun". 

We then had to position/link cards such as:
- "Cloud & Data centres, 
- "WiFi, 4G/5G, networks", 
- "Ecological backpack", 
- "Using a console, smartphone or computer", 
- "Electricity consumption", 
- "Internet use",
- "Consumption of fossil fuels".

Each card included an explanation of its impact on the environment.

As time was very limited, Celine and Laurent gave us a quick explanation of the 3 other stages of a digital collage:
- The **creativity phase**, during which the participants illustrate what they have said and the messages they have retained
- The **presentation phase**, during which each group presents its fresco to the other groups
- The **action phase**, during which the actions are classified according to two criteria: ease of implementation and degree of impact. This structuring of the actions enables the groups to quickly identify the quick-wins to be implemented (high impact & ease of implementation).

Thank you to the organisers for taking up the challenge of showing us how to create a digital collage in 20 minutes. It makes you want to give it a try!
