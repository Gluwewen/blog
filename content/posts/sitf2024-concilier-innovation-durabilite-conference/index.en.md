description: "The Swiss IT forum(s) 2024 was held on 26 and 27 September at Palexpo (Geneva). It's a major event in Geneva where companies come to present their business and IT solutions, and this year the digital transition and AI were the subjects in the spotlight. In this series of articles, I'll be sharing with you some of the conferences I had the pleasure of attending, including the conference on reducing the environmental impact of your projects: what strategies can you use to reconcile innovation and sustainability?"

This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland. So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes).

*Conference hosted by [Estelle Veille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/estelleveille/), [Lydia Allet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-allet-698391104/) and [Thibault Couhin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaultcouhin/) from [Collaboration Betters The World](https://collaborationbetterstheworld.com)*

Lydia and Estelle presented a few practices aimed at reducing the environmental impact of projects, helping to reconcile innovation with sustainability. This list of actions is an excerpt from the eco-design checklist made available by the [GreenIT.fr collective](https://collectif.greenit.fr), and from [Frederic Bordage](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fbordage/)'s excellent book, "Eco-conception Web: les 115 bonnes pratiques".

Lydia introduced the 115 eco-design levers, categorized by priority and by field:
1. **Specification:** The first lever to limit impact, and the good news is that only 5% of the checklist practices are needed to make improvements!
2. **UX/UI Design:** The second lever with already more practices to implement (24%).

The eco-design levers rely for two-thirds on the upstream phases of building a business process (specification, functional design, technical design). The remaining one-third is divided between two-thirds for hosting and one-third for implementation. So, eco-design is primarily not a developer's responsibility as one might think!

3. **Technical Implementation:** 62% of the practices help improve this phase.
4. **Hosting:** 5% of the practices.
5. **Marketing/Analytics:** 4% of the practices.

CBTW recommends focusing efforts on the following points:
- Sustainable software design
- Electronic waste optimisation and management
- Cloud infrastructure and data centers optimization

## Sustainable software design

To achieve this, CBTW encourages:

- **implementing Product Design phases** to identify the truly necessary features, thus avoiding unnecessary development that consumes resources
- **adopting a modular and scalable design** to ensure systems are flexible, easily adaptable, and capable of evolving with future changes
- **optimizing resources and content** to improve the performance and efficiency of solutions, as well as their carbon footprint
- **optimizing code to improve efficiency**, speed, and maintainability while ensuring optimal performance across a wide range of devices.

## Electronic Waste Optimization and Management

For this, CBTW suggests:

- **buying responsibly**, prioritizing equipment suited to needs, certified as ecological, refurbished if possible, and easily repairable
- **renting or sharing machines for temporary needs** (e.g., rentshop.ch or liverental.ch)
- **disposing of functional equipment** by donating it to Emmaus, Caritas, or even Videologic
- **disposing of non-functional equipment** by dropping it off with Swico, who will collect it free of charge for at least 250 kg of equipment.

## Cloud infrastructure and data centers optimization

CBTW suggests:

- **adopting eco-design techniques**, prioritizing local data processing, implementing lightweight architectures, and using efficient algorithms
- **choosing Cloud storage**, such as AWS or Azure, provided the hosting is in a data center with a low PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and powered by low-carbon energy
- **integrating eco-design into company policy**, developing a dedicated CSR strategy, and setting up green KPIs, monitoring, and audits.
