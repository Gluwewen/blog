This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland. So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes).

*Resilio Tech demonstration by [Amael Parreaux-Ey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amael-parreaux-ey/) (Resilio)*
*[Resilio](https://resilio-solutions.com/fr/) is an EPFL spinoff, strongly inspired by the [GreenIT.fr](https://collectif.greenit.fr) collective.*

Instead of simply giving us a demonstration of the Resilio tech tool, Amael recontextualised the reason for the carbon footprint and why it should be exceeded, starting with the 9 planetary limits, 6 of which have unfortunately already been exceeded...

Amael reminded us that there are 3 priority regulations for the digital sector, which will govern the environmental declaration of companies, whether for their products, activities or suppliers:
- **The duty of care** stemming from the CSDDD (Corporate Sustainability, Due Diligence Directive) requiring large companies and their business partners to prevent, stop or mitigate the negative impact of their activities on human rights and the environment from 2025-2026.
- **Company footprint** resulting from the CSRD (Corporate Sustanaibility Reporting Directive) requiring companies and institutions to provide standardised extra-financial reporting on 10 standards from 2025 (climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, use of resources and circular economy, human workforce, workers in the value chain, communities affected, consumers and end users, business conduct).
- **Product footprint** resulting from the Green claims voted in April 2024 aimed at preventing greenwashing and enabling consumers to make informed purchasing decisions.

A carbon footprint only covers the climate change standard. A LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) is a holistic method covering the first 5 environmental standards.

It's true that in France, whether it's politicians or the media, they only talk about climate change and omit the 8 other planetary limits. This doesn't make it any easier to understand the regulations and adopt the associated constraints.

Amael then presents Resilio's overall LCA approach, which is divided into 4 stages:
- **Prepare**: definition of the scope of the study and preparatory work.
- **Carry out**: collection of physical inventory data and assessment of the organisation's maturity via a review of best practices 
- **Validate**: organise the data collected, validate the inventory and check the consistency of the data, then calculate the footprint and maturity.
- **Act**: take stock in terms of inventory, footprint and maturity, benchmark the footprint against the average of companies already studied, make recommendations for building the action plan, present the results to the project team, then simulate the plan's actions.

Personally, I feel that there is one point missing from the approach described: raising employee awareness on sustainable IT, in order to make it easier and more transparent to gather data and take action once the plan has been drawn up. 
Knowing Resilio, this aspect is also covered in their approach, and brilliantly so by Celine Carle-Faye, head of training and gamification at Resilio.

Once this context had been described, Amael showed us some screenshots of the Resilio tech tool, and in particular :
- Inventory supervision;
- Collection of the inventory, which can be done by importing the export file from a CMDB, by entering the technical characteristics of the equipment (storage, memory, etc.) or by entering the equipment reference;
- Collecting the information needed to assess the organisation's maturity.
- Customisable dashboards

Finally, during the Q&A session, a very interesting question was asked about Swiss regulations: what regulations and when? Amael told us that the Federal Council launched a consultation this summer with the aim of having a federal law fully aligned with European law within 2 to 2.5 years. So that's tomorrow!
