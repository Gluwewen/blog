‘After developing financial software in USA, UK and France as part of an American start-up specialised in financial software development, I have been helping development teams, organisations and managers to adopt an Agile philosophy for over 15 years. 

Convinced by the growing impact of digital technology on the environment, I try at my humble level to raise awareness of the urgent need to change our software development practices and to help digital product managers and development teams adopt more reasoned approaches to the creation of digital services.

Why have to choose between accessibility of digital services, financial profit and respect for the environment? Embrace a sustainable development approach!’
