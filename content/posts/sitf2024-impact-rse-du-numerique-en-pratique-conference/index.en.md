This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland. So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes).

After a brief presentation of her company Verdikt, Helene would like to share three different pieces of feedback on the implementation of sustainable IT.

## The CSR impact of IT in a large company

This large company employs over 80,000 people in more than 100 business units around the world. The company is one of the leaders in sustainable IT and is looking to improve and manage its impact far beyond carbon. 

In three months, across 20 business units, with over 200,000 pieces of IT equipment and millions of Cloud usages, the company's impact analysis showed a score of 51/100, which may not seem like much at first glance, but nevertheless places the company in the top 10% in terms of maturity, with less than 500 kg CO2 equivalent per employee.

The benefits of this maturity analysis include 
- facilitating management sponsorship and employee commitment;
- identify the priorities to be addressed
- identify possible cost optimisations.

The next steps for this company are
- define a strategy for implementing the action plans
- extend the approach to other business units
- automate data collection and monitoring.

## The CSR impact of digital products

The head of the digital factory department of a company with over 160,000 employees, operating in several countries around the world, and with over 1,000 applications in its portfolio wanted to carry out a multi-dimensional audit to come up with actionable recommendations and comply with regulatory frameworks.

In 3 months, Verdikt analysed two web applications, managed by a team distributed around the world, with a total of 15,000 users per month.
The analysis of the company's impact showed a score between 40 and 60, with one application closer to 40 and the other closer to 60. Verdikt provided around 170 recommendations to improve the environmental impact of these two applications.

Once the action plan had been implemented, the team was able to reduce the impact of its web applications by around 30%, gaining 20 points on the maturity score and moving them into the top 1%.

The next steps for the company are to:
- scale up the approach to cover all the applications in the portfolio under management
- train employees in sustainable development
- monitor the objectives to be achieved

## The CSR impact of IT Projects

For this third and final feedback session, Helene tells us about a CIO from a company with 50,000 employees managing 100 projects, each worth more than one million euros. The CIO wanted to evaluate and compare different scenarios across all types of projects. To do this, Verdikt assessed three pilot projects, each exceeding 5 million euros, over a period of 3 months:
- an industrial systems refurbishment project,
- a digital workplace strategy project,
- a business process digitalization project.

The analysis provided an assessment of the projects' carbon emissions in tCO2 equivalents, although the specific figures were not provided.

From this analysis, the company was able to introduce a new RoE (Return on Environment) KPI, which all projects must evaluate before receiving funding for launch.

On this conference, I found it interesting to see the areas where companies are focusing their efforts to reduce the environmental impact of their activities. However, I was disappointed by how these three cases were only briefly covered. It left me wanting more. I would have preferred a single, more detailed presentation, with the participation of the company involved.
