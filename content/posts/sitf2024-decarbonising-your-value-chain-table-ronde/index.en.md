This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland. So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes).

Stephanie gave us a long and interesting introduction highlighting the need to change, the need to regain control over our actions for the good of the planet we live on. I really appreciated this introduction. On the other hand, the various existing tools for decarbonising the value chain and how to choose them is a subject that is far too "tool" oriented for my liking. 

However, there were three things I would take away from this round table:
1. There is a plethora of tools on the decarbonisation market, as shown in the photo below.
2. The main criteria for selecting a tool are: the size of the company (SME, ETI, GE), the price of the solution and the level of expertise on the subject required to make full use of the tool.
3. Software publishers are focusing their efforts on making it easy to retrieve data. The generation of regulatory reports is no longer so much a means of differentiating these solutions.

When I compare these solutions to the "niche players" in Green IT, which only measure digital impact but on many indicators other than carbon alone, I find that these publishers have fallen behind in their ability to help people make decisions and take action. Benoit was the only one who kept hammering away at this message: a good point that has engraved the name of his **Odoo** solution in my head.
