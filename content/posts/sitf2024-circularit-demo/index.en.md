This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland. So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes).

Before presenting his company, Ivan starts with a shock question:
> "Do you know how long it takes on average for the carbon footprint of using a smartphone to equal the carbon footprint of building it? 346 years!"
>
> -Ivan Mariblanca Flinch

He invites us to reflect on our **irreasonable** consumption of electronic equipment. What if we tried to extend the lifespan of our equipment by replacing new purchases with reconditioned ones, or by donating our old equipment that is still functional to relatives or people in need?

After this shocking question, Ivan presented his company, MIKUJY, and in particular its mission: 
> "We measure and help companies to reduce the carbon footprint of their information systems and support them throughout their sustainable digital journey."

MIKUJY is unique in that it is the first Swiss company to offer an all-in-one solution with:
- An assessment of IT's footprint on the 8 measurable environmental indicators and the maturity of organisations in relation to sustainable IT practices;
- Strategy creation;
- The creation of action plans;
- Change management, by promoting employee awareness via workshops enhanced by didactic videos and games calling on collective intelligence
- Certification training for employees;
- And certification in sustainable IT.

MIKUJY is the only company to certify organisations on sustainable IT in Switzerland (NR label from the ISIT-CH association).

To support MIKUJI's activities, Ivan introduced us to the various modules of the [CircularIT](https://circularit.mikujy.com/) web platform.

## MeasureIT
This 1st module aims to help companies measure the environmental footprint of their information systems using the Life Cycle Assessment method.
Here too, the solution seems to make it easy to collect the inventory, either manually or automatically via an API. CircularIT's well thought-out and polished interface makes it easy to visualise data reports and compare them with other companies already studied.

Thanks to subsidies from the OFEV (Federal Office for the Environment), MIKUJY is able to assess the environmental footprint of your IS and compare it with that of your peers, all at no cost to you! [Contact them](https://mikujy.com/contacter/)!

## PredictIT
This module simulates the future IT footprint and provides advice for optimal decisions. It models the evolution of the environmental footprint of an IS in response, for example, to changes in the lifespan and quantity of devices. This makes it much easier to take decisions on selecting the most relevant actions to implement.

Key ambitions:
- Anticipate the digital footprint;
- Optimise digital assets and reduce costs;
- Align IT objectives with environmental objectives;
- Simplify strategic decision-making;
- Improve transparency and predictability.

## ImplementIT
Implementing a sustainable IT strategy is crucial to significantly reducing the environmental impact of digital. This module provides each department with its concrete actions to implement, facilitating and accelerating the adoption and deployment of the sustainable IT strategy. 

Main ambitions:
- Prioritise actions according to an organisation's maturity;
- Implement SMART objectives;
- Monitor live the evolution of an organisation's maturity, by department;
- Produce a strategy progress report.

## GameIT
The aim of this latest module is to encourage employees to make the transition to sustainable IT by having fun through learning and taking part in interactive games.

Main ambitions:
- Fun and profitable challenges
- Involve employees in the sustainable IT strategy
- Provide over 50 actions to implement
- Identify ambassadors

Ivan reveals the availability of a major feature for a future version of CircularIT: **measuring the impact of "Machine Learning"**, a field of study in artificial intelligence aimed at giving machines the ability to learn from data and mathematical models.
